# Grass is Green

## Description
`The challenge file is present in the same directory with the name challenge.jpg`

## Solution

1. This was a easy problem and I found the flag on viewing this image through different panes.
2. As the name suggests green, on viewing this image through `Stegsolve` the flag could be found.
3. This can also be done using this website -> https://stegonline.georgeom.net/   [Lsb Half]
