# Heaven

## Description

"I was in the seventh heaven painted red green and blue"

`The challenge file is uploaded in the same directory with the name challenge.jpeg`

## Solution

1. On using `Ghex` I found out that the challenge file is actually a png and not jpeg.

2. So I converted this jpeg image to png.

**Command**
```console
mv challenge.jpeg challenge.png
```

3. The description says it all [`seventh, red green and blue`], this challenge is related to bit manipulation.
4. I used `stegsolve` and found the flag!
