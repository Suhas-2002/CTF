# Alien Communication

## Description
Aliens are trying to communicate something. They belive in seeing more than what they are hearing. can you help us trying to decode what they are trying to say?

`The challenge file is present in the same directory with the name challenge.wav`

## Solution

1. As the description says `they belive in seeing more`, the word **seeing** hints to view the audio spectogram!
2. On using Audacity and viewing the spectogram of the audio file the flag was found.
