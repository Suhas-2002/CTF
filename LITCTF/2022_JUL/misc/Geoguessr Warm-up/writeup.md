Alternate Method

By looking at the image the sign on the left almost certainly belongs to a pub (Arms in the name, the font) and the sign on the wall belongs to the British beer brand Bass. If you squint you should even be able to see "Supplies Ltd" at the end of the next sign too, implying that this is in an English speaking territory. The most significant British territory with a Southern European, temperate climate is Gibraltar. Google gibraltar + pub + arms to find the Edinburgh Arms. 

flag format -> LITCTF{lattitude,longitude} and roundoff the lat and long to 3 decimal places.
