## Solution

#### Method-1

1. Use this link -> https://yandex.com/ to find the name of the place given in the challenge file.
2. Once you find the name, map it on Google maps and take out the latitude and longitude.
3. [ latitude and longitude can be found in the address bar ]

#### Method-2

By looking at the image the sign on the left almost certainly belongs to a pub (Arms in the name, the font) and the sign on the wall belongs to the British beer brand Bass. If you squint you should even be able to see "Supplies Ltd" at the end of the next sign too, implying that this is in an English speaking territory. The most significant British territory with a Southern European, temperate climate is Gibraltar. Google gibraltar + pub + arms to find the Edinburgh Arms. 

`flag format -> LITCTF{lattitude,longitude} and roundoff the lattitude and longitude to 3 decimal places.`
